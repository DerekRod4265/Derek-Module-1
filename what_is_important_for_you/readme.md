## What is important for you?

My family, friends, and striving for academic success and taking care of both your mental and 
physical health are all things I find important. My priorities reflect on my commitment to creating a happy and fulfilling life for myself. 
Maintaining these aspects of my life contributes to my overall happiness and well-being.
